## Project Motivation

The purpose of this project is to choose a dataset, prepare the data, perform data analysis and communicate the results. I was interested in using AirBnB data to answer the following questions:

1. What areas have the highest priced AirBnB homes?
2. What do the different types of properties earn on Average? How do prices differ between between Seattle and Boston?
3. What are factors that mostly affect AirbnB prices?


## Contents of the Repository

Readme.md:  This file, describing the contents of this repo.

AirBnB_final.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis performed.

Sources files:
* s_listings.csv - The csv file containing the Seattle AirBnB listings.
* b_listings.csv - The csv file containing the Boston AirBnB listings.

## Libraries required:

* numpy and pandas - For data manipulations
* os and gmaps - To set system variables and enable use of gmaps.
* matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn - For showing plots
* sklearn linear_model, LinearRegression, model_selection, train_test_split, metrics,r2_score - To perform machine learning and check accuracy.

### Summary of results

The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog post here: : https://medium.com/@tobikasali/decisions-decisions-decisions-24acd05d4585.

A closer and more detailed look at the analysis can be found in the jupyter notebook here.


### Licenses and Acknowledgements

The dataset can be found on Kaggle with other licnesing information.
